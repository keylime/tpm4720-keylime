------------------------------

Server - the TPM
Client - the TPM applications (e.g., test suite)

---------
Compiling
---------

See README for compiler options.


---------------------------------
Server environment variables are:
---------------------------------

TPM_PATH (server)

	The full path to the directory where the server stores
	non-volatile data.

	If more than one TPM server is running on the same platform
	(e.g., to test key migration), each TPM must have a unique
	TPM_PATH.

	It is recommended (but not required) that this directory be
	otherwise empty, because:

	1 - The TPM uses hard coded file names.  Using a unique
	directory ensures that there will be no accidental name
	collisions.

	2 - At times, one wants to return the TPM to factory defaults
	by deleting all TPM data from the directory.  This is easier
	if there are no other files present.

TPM_PORT (server)

	For TCP/IP sockets:

	The TCP/IP socket port where the TPM server listens for TPM
	commands from the client application.

	For Unix Domain Sockets:

	The Unix domain socket file name where the TPM server listens
	for TPM commands from the client application.

TPM_SERVER_NAME (client)

	The server host name or IP address.

TPM_SERVER_PORT (client)

	For TCP/IP sockets:

	The TCP/IP socket port the TPM client uses to send commands to
	the TPM.


------------------
Running the server
------------------

The executable is tpm_server (Unix) or tpm_server.exe (Windows).

It does not require root (Unix) or Administrator (Windows) privileges.

The first time through, non-volatile storage is created and saved.
After the first time, this non-volatile storage is read and used to
initialize the TPM.

Since the TPM is 'shipped' deactivated, the procedure for the
first time is:

- start the server

	> tpm_server

- simulate BIOS and activating the TPM

	> tpmbios

- abort and restart (reboot) the server 

	> ^C
	> tpm_server

- simulate BIOS

	> tpmbios

After the TPM is activated, each restart required only:

	> tpm_server
	> tpmbios

Implementation note: The server and client both break the socket
connection after each response is returned.  Since the TPM has no
explicit 'disconnect' command, clients may not know if multiple
commands are to be sent, and a broken client should not tie up the
server, this is the cleanest approach.

----------
Trace Data
----------

For debugging, extensive tracing to routed to stdout.  Typically, this
it piped to a log file.  For example:

	> tpm_server >! tpm.log

By convention, all errors detected by the TPM server include the
string 'Error'.  Errors that cause the TPM to go into failure mode
include the string "Fatal'.

---------------------
Testing
---------------------

- - - - - - - - - -
IBM Regression Test
- - - - - - - - - -

Test scripts are located in the .../host/libtpm2.0/utils directory,
with a dependency on library functions in .../host/libtpm2.0/lib.

For a basic test, use

	> tpmbios

This does a TPM_Startup, sets physical presence, enables and activates
the TPM.

Additional quick tests are
	
	> createek
	> takeown -pwdo ooo -pwds sss

For a regression test, use

	> bash
	> test_console.sh 2>&1 | tee error.log4j

which displays a list of tests and options.  The regression test
requires two TPM servers in order to test key migration.  By
convention, one server is at 6543 and one at 6545.  An example of how
to run two TPMs after the environment variables are set is:

Shell with 6543 environment:

> tpm_server >! tpm.log

Shell with 6545 environment:

> tpm_server >! tpm6545.log

- - - - - - - - - -
TCG Test Suite
- - - - - - - - - -

Start with a 'factory fresh' TPM by removing all state.

Compile with 'makefile-ts'

Initialize with this script:

> ./tpmbios
> ./physicalpresence -c
> ./physicalpresence -x 04
> ./physicalpresence -x 80
> ./createek
> ./nv_definespace -ix ffffffff -sz 0
> ./takeown -pwdo ownerAuth -pwds srkAuth

Use this script if the test suite prompts for a reboot.
        Do it twice if the test suite indicates that the TPM is disabled.

> ./tpmbios
> ./physicalpresence -x 10
> ./physicalpresence -x 04

Use this script when the test suite prompts for a force clear,
typically followed by two more reboots.

> ./tpmbios
> ./forceclear

Run the test suite using this command:

> ./tpmtest -ibm localhost:6543

Examples - varies with trousers install path

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/root/trousers-0.3.1/src/tspi/.libs

Add to /usr/local/etc/tcsd.conf:

remote_ops = seal,unseal,registerkey,unregisterkey,loadkey,createkey,sign,random,getcapability,unbind,quote,readpubek,getregisteredkeybypublicinfo,getpubkey,selftest

Must be owner/group/mode tss/tss/0600

> export TESTSUITE_OWNER_SECRET="ownerAuth"
> export TESTSUITE_SRK_SECRET="srkAuth"

> /root/trousers-0.3.1/src/tcsd/tcsd -f > tss.log 2>&1

> ./tpmbios
> ./createek
> ./takeown -pwdo ownerAuth -pwds srkAuth

./tsstests.sh -v 1.2 &> logfile
