Introduction
------------

This release has three parts:

.../lib: A library of low level TPM function calls.  

.../utils: A large number of small command line programs that call the
above library.  These are useful for learning and playing with the
TPM.

.../utils/test_console.sh: A bash script that strings together the
command line programs to form a TPM regression test.  The tests are in
a subdirectory .../utils/modules.

The instructions below are for Linux.  The lib and utils have been
ported to Windows.  The bash script has not.

Prerequisites
-------------

OpenSSL: 

The test suite requires OpenSSL for low level crypto operations.  

It has been tested with 0.9.8 and 1.0.0 (Linux) and 0.9.8 (Windows).

For Linux source, see 

	http://www.openssl.org 

To determine the OpenSSL version installed:

	> openssl version

For Windows binaries, see 

	http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html 

The build is known to work for RHEL 5.2 and later. We do not support
earlier versions.


Quick Compile - Linux
-------------

A number of build scripts are included for useful configurations.

NOTE: This library and the TPM must match.  For example, both or
neither must use vTPM extensions.

comp-sockets.sh		: TCP/IP socket interface, standard TPM
comp-chardev.sh		: character device interface, standard TPM
comp-serialp.sh         : character device interface, TPM on serial port
comp-unixio.sh		: Unix domain socket interface, standard TPM


Compiling - Linux
---------

The TPM library contains a number of low-level utilities for creating
and managing keys, signing and encrypting data, and using data and
keys in a secure way.

The library, called libtpm.a, will be in the ./lib subdirectory, the
utilities in the ./utils subdirectory.

Unless using the 'Quick Compile" scripts, do:

> ./autogen
> ./configure
> make

This compiles the library for communication over TCP sockets. The
./configure has to be replaced with

> ./configure --enable-chardev

if the tools are supposed to be compiled for communication with a TPM
through /dev/tpm0.

To compile the library with communication over UnixIO sockets, it must
be configured as follows:

> ./configure --enable-unixio

Note: A fairly recent automake/autoconf environment is needed to properly
      generate the Makefiles etc. Fedora Core 3 and 4 provide the 
      necessary versions of these tools.

If 'make install' is also done, the library will be moved to the
default library location, usually /usr/local/lib, the include files
will be moved to /usr/local/include.

In addition, a number of sample utilities are provided for using the
TPM library.  They will be in the ./utils subdirectory after the
package has been built. If 'make install' is done, the utilities will
be installed in /usr/local/bin.

See the INSTALL file for more information on changing the location
where the files will be installed.

Compiling - Windows
---------

The Windows port uses only the TCP/IP socket interface.  Use the TPM
proxy to connect to a hardware TPM.

Compile using MinGW and makefile.mak

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
	http://wingw.org

Compile the ...\lib directory first to create the DLL.  Then compile
the ...\utils directory.

The ...\utils directory requires the file applink.c.  See the OpenSSL
FAQ at:
	
	http://www.openssl.org/support/faq.html#PROG2

	If the applink.c file is not copied, some versions of gcc will
	give the misleading error: No rule to make target 'xxx.exe'.

Copy the DLL to a place in the Windows DLL path.  E.g., copy to the
...\utils directory.


Preprocessor defines
--------------------

The following preprocessor variables have been defined for the TPM library:

TPM_USE_CHARDEV   Generate client code to talk to a TPM using character
                  device communication. This is the typical way of 
                  communicating with a hardware TPM or as a matter of fact
                  we are also using this for communication with the virtual
                  TPM when for example running the tools inside a VM.

TPM_USE_UNIXIO    Generate client code to talk to a TPM using UnixIO socket
                  communication.

TPM_MAXIMUM_KEY_SIZE  Build a library with support for a maximum key size
                      for public key cryptography as given. The default 
                      value applied by the configure script is 4096 (bits).

USE_SERIAL_PORT   Generate code so that the tools can communicate to a 
                  TPM behind a serial port. This define works only in
                  conjunction with TPM_USE_CHARDEV.

USE_PARTIAL_READ  When receiving responses from a TPM and if the device 
                  driver allows it, this define enables code to read
                  a whole TPM response with multiple read()s. A first
                  read may for example read the header of the response
                  up to the indicator for the size of the response, then
                  allocate the necessary buffer and only then read the
                  rest of the packet.

IBM TPM Regression Test Suite
-----------------------------

	- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
	Socket-enabled Software TPM
	- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

After the make it should be possible to run the test suite against the
TPM. Please run it against a socket-enable TPM first and compile the
library for sockets as well! Then do the following using a bash shell:

If the TPM is using TCP/IP sockets and listening on port 6543:

> export TPM_SERVER_PORT=6543 

If the TPM is using Unix domain sockets and listening at file name
/tmp/tpmdomain

> export TPM_UNIXIO_PATH=/tmp/tpmdomain

If the TPM is using sockets and running on the same machine as the
test suite.

> export TPM_SERVER_NAME=localhost 

Start the TPM in another shell after setting its environment variables
                     (TPM_PATH,TPM_PORT)

> cd utils
> ./tpmbios

Kill the TPM in the other shell and restart it

> ./tpmbios

     The directory specified by TPM_PATH will now have the file
     00.permall. Once these files are available you can immediately
     process to the next step whenever you start the TPM.

The test suite also requires a 2nd TPM for the key migration test. A
2nd TPM should be started on a different port (TPM_PORT) and with a
different path for its state files (TPM_PATH) to avoid collisions of
the state information written into the 00.* files. The 2nd TPM should
be running in a different shell and have been initialized using the
same procedure as above. By default the test suite expects this 2nd
TPM to be running on port 6545 (see utils/modules/test_constants
variables SLAVE_TPM_PORT) on the same system as the test suite.

> export SLAVE_TPM_PORT=6545
> export SLAVE_TPM_SERVER=localhost

	- - - - - - -
	Hardware TPM 
	- - - - - - -

The TPM_SERVER_PORT and TPM_SERVER_NAME environment variables are not
required.

On a production platform that implements a TCG BIOS, this section
should not be required.  The BIOS should have run TPM_Startup, and the
manufacturing process should have enabled and activated the TPM.

For a test platform:

The first ./tpmbios emulates startup commands normally run by the
BIOS.  It also enables and activates the TPM.  Normally, the TPM
requires a reboot to activate the TPM.  Before doing this, test to see
if the TPM is already enabled and activated:

> ./getcapability -cap 4 -scap 108

If Disabled is TRUE or Deactivated is TRUE something failed in the
./tpmbios command.

Next 

> ./getcapability -cap 4 -scap 109

if Deactivated is FALSE, the TPM is ready for use.  Otherwise reboot
and retry.  It should succeed after the reboot

	Test Suite
	- - - - - -

Now move on to the test suite:

	Since the test suite affects TPM persistent state, including
	some lifetime locks, the entire state in TPM_PATH should be
	removed before running the test suite.

Using the bash shell:

./test_console.sh 2>&1 | tee out.log4j

Then type the test item you want to run. 

For a software TPM, to run all tests type 'all'.

	Do not run 'all' against a hardware TPM, as it will create
	lifetime locks.  For a hardware TPM, select 'hwtpm'.

With the above command the test suite will write all output also into
the file out.log4j.  This file should be looked at.  Errors are
indicated with 'ERROR' and reflect a serious problem. Warnings are
indicated with 'WARN' and can be ignored.


Runtime environment variables
-----------------------------

A number of environment variables can be used to select the behavior of the
TPM library and its applications. 


TPM_SERVER_NAME and TPM_SERVER_PORT : 
				These two variables define the
				IP address and port where the TPM is
				running on. These variables need only
				be set if sockets are used for
				communication. Examples are:
				TPM_SERVER_NAME=localhost
				TPM_SERVER_PORT=6543

TPM_DEVICE : This variable can be set if a character device is used for
             communication with the TPM. The default value is '/dev/tpm0'
             when this variable is not set.

TPM_UNIXIO_PATH : If the library was compiled for communication with the
                  TPM over UnixIO sockets then the path to the UnixIO
                  socket must be given through this environment variable.

TPM_SESSION : With this variable the preferred session type may be chosen,
              such as 'oiap', 'osap' or 'dsap'. Each TPM function will
              choose the most appropriate type of session. For example,
              if a function supports only 'oiap', but 'dsap' is chosen,
              it will fall back to use oiap. If a function supports
              'oiap', 'osap' and 'dsap', then it will use whatever this
              variable indicates.
 
TPM_ET_ENCRYPT_AES : Certain OSAP session parameters will be encrypted
                     using AES cipher if this env. variable is set to
                     '1'.

TPM_TRANSPORT : If this environment variable is set to '1', the test suite
                will try to use transport mode whenever possible.

TPM_TRANSPORT_ENC : If TPM_TRANSPORT has been set to '1', then this 
                    environment variable declares the type of encryption
                    being used. The default is 'MGF1'. Possible values
                    are 'MGF1', 'OFB' or 'CTR'.

TPM_DUMP_COMMANDS: Dumps the TPM requests and responses to the screen for
                   all transaction between the utilities and the (v)TPM.

TPM_NO_KEY_SWAP : If this environment variable is set to "1", then do not
                  swap any keys. Do not set it in connection with transport
                  mode!

TPM_HW_DRIVER : If this environment variable is set, the TPM_SHA1Update
		limits the TPM driver buffer size to 2048 to accommodate the
		Linux driver. 

		This buffer size is always used when TPM_USE_CHARDEV
		is defined.  This environment variable is typically
		used when the utilities are compiled for sockets, but
		the socket server is actually a proxy for a hardware TPM.
